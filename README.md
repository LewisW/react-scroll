# react-iscroller

An effective react infinite scroll container. inspired by twitter's [blog](http://itsze.ro/blog/2017/04/09/infinite-list-and-react.html).

## Motivation

As the pwa(progressive web app) becoming more popular, the performance and user experience are more and more important. And infinite scroll is almost the most important part within a pwa project. But i found the results by searching `react infinite scroller` on github are not my needs. Fortunately, I found this article of [twitter](https://medium.com/@paularmstrong/twitter-lite-and-high-performance-react-progressive-web-apps-at-scale-d28a00e780a3) on medium by chance. That's i want. So I tried to implement one.

## Install

```sh
npm i react-iscroller
```

## Example

It's simple to use as follow:

```ts
import { InfiniteScroller } from "react-iscroller"

return <InfiniteScroller
  itemAverageHeight={22}
  containerHeight={window.innerHeight}
  items={this.state.messages}
  itemKey="id"
  onRenderCell={this.renderCell}/>
```
